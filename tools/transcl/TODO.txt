(1) The rangecl(-) function seems not very useful after all - its corresponding witness theorem is too strong. Remove it from the C++ and ML code!

(2) Implement an automatic tactic to prove acyclicity of a relation using the transcl(-) command.

(3) There are some issues with simplifying the provisos of the witness lemma - this, by default, does not work as swiftly as I hoped. Perhaps configure some evaluation method to do this more efficiently, competing with plain (eval) on the initial goal "acyclic R".

(4) There may be potential issues with using echo in transcl.ML due to special characters. It may thus be better to write the result into a file. This will also save time not having to escape double quotes.

(5) Do a final review of the entire C++ and ML code.
